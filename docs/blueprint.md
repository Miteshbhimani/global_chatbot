# **App Name**: WebChat Navigator

## Core Features:

- Website Input: Accept a website URL as input from the user.
- Agent Creation: Automatically create a chat agent upon receiving the website URL. This agent will be scoped to the particular website.
- Chat Interface: Provide a chat interface, mimicking the appearance of WhatsApp.
- Content Retrieval: The chat agent should have the tool to retrieve and summarize information from the target website based on user queries.
- Link Navigation: Allow the user to navigate the website by following the URLs returned by the agent in the chat interface.
- History Tracking: The agent should have the tool to retain chat history and context within a session.
- Session Management: Enable session persistence, meaning a user can return to previous agents.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, but professional, medium blue (#29ABE2) to suggest knowledge.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue-gray (#F0F8FF) for a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: A bright yellowish-green (#9ACD32) to indicate when the AI agent is communicating, and to highlight key interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, should be used for both headlines and body text, because it offers a modern and neutral aesthetic appropriate to extended reading on screen.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different actions and website sections.
- The layout should mimic a WhatsApp interface, with a clear separation between user and agent messages.
- Subtle animations when the agent is processing information or when new messages arrive.
